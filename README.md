My Research
======

I apply methods from *Formal Verification* to the domain of *Multi-Robot Systems* by synthesizing correct-by-design strategies over *Linear Time Logic* specifications in a scalable manner. Strategy negotation through assumption exchange between agents, but also between agents and humans are the overarching theme of my work.

Private Interests
------

In my free time, I enjoy to play and study the game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) and dabble in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Some repositories might be related to these topics!
