# My Research

I am a PhD student at the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) in the [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) under supervision by [Jana Tumova](https://people.kth.se/~tumova/home.html). I am also an affiliated PhD student in the [WASP program](https://wasp-sweden.org/).

I apply methods from *Formal Verification* to the domain of *Multi-Robot Systems* by synthesizing correct-by-design strategies over *Linear Time Logic* specifications in a scalable manner. Strategy negotation through assumption exchange between agents, but also between agents and humans are the overarching theme of my work.
